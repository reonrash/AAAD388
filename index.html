              <p>"Insecure" is a comedy show that follows the friendship of two modern-day black women, Issa Dee (Issa Rae) and Molly (Yvonne Orji). The show depicts the afflictions and triumphs of the two women navigating their lives as they enter their thirties, trying to come to terms with their own flaws, all while not giving a f*** about what others think. Their journey throughout the show reveals the all too common experience of black women in America as they attempt to thrive in an environment entrenched in stereotypes, racism, classism, sexism, and other societal oppressions restraining black excellence. "Insecure" not only brings to light the everyday conflicts that black women come to face in their lives, but also acts as a commentary and outlet for others to understand the black woman's experience in America. "Insecure" deals with broad issues such as gentrification, schooling, mental health, and classism within a black experience but also has a clear focus on  issues centering black women such as job dynamics, hair policing, relationships, dating, and other real life issues. By watching "Insecure" students will achieve a general understanding of a black women's experience in contemporary society. While trying to understand this experience, students will engage with black feminist thought regarding the themes and issues within the show. By pairing the readings and show together, students should attain a breadth of knowledge regarding various ideas within black feminist thought and how they can be used to solve problems in today's society.

By reading this study we will examine how black women lay at a unique intersection in the matrix of domination that of which puts them at a compromising position in dealing with multi-layered stressors. The position in which these black women find themselves have many parallels to Molly and Issa in "Insecure" and all black woman navigating other parts of their life, to which students can draw upon as a microstudy of everyday life for all black woman.</p>

This essay will be read in order to understand the viewpoint of black women when they choose certain styles and designate others as “bad” and the historical and contemporary significance behind those choices. The politics of hair is a reoccuring theme within "Insecure" as we have varying hairstyles within the show acknowledged in “bad” and “good” ways. Understanding how this landscape has been created and shaped to this day will give students a better understanding of a divisive topic.</p>

                  <p>This essay “addresses the need for an intersectional analysis of battered women syndrome based upon race and gender”. Our primary reason for looking at this piece is to understand how black women position in the matrix of dominant puts them at position that cannot be understood when looking at from a single origin, but must be viewed from differing perspectives to truly grasp the situation. The essay reveals the real life implications of intersectionality blindness and how it can lead to the literally beating of black women. This shows how a black woman is needed when solving problems dealing with black woman as reflected in the show with Issa working as youth works liaison to a primarily low income black school.

                  <p>A “Woman Speaks” is a short poem by Audre Lorde from “The Collected Work of Audre Lorde”. In the poem Lorde speaks of an affirmation of power, solidarity, and isolation with black women. Students will examine the poem and seek to understand the messages Lorde is trying to communicate about black women. After doing so students should try to relate the resistance spoken in “A Woman Speaks” to the struggle of Issa and Molly trying to navigate their own problems.

                  <p>The origin of Issa and Molly’s relationship is their sorority. Their sorority and the friendship network it provides is a constant talking point in “Insecure”, and also acts as a commentary for other issues such as classism, sexism, role of support groups, and more. However, we will focus primarily on the benefits that a sorority provides for black women by reading this Essay published by DeLores J. Allison. “This qualitative research study explored the experiences of NPHC Black sorority women at a predominantly White institution and the benefits that their individual sororities provided. The theory that guided this study is Black feminist thought, which reveals the complexity of Black women’s experiences.”</p>

                  <p>Morrison’s poem “The Average Black Girl” details the struggle of being a black woman by discussing the varying faucets of microaggressions and oppression she faces throughout her life because of her identity. In her poem Morrison speaks heavily about the tokenism of black women and how issues such as “talking white”, colorism, and other societal constructs are used against her, to tell her being a black woman is inherently bad. The oppression to which Morrison speaks has parallels to Molly and Issa in “Insecure”. After watching the video on her poem students should be able to recognize the microaggressions and constant oppression black woman come under in their everyday lives and how they try to surmount these problems on an individual level.</p>

                  <p>“Eloquent Rage” commands black woman to not shy from their passionate rage but to use it as fuel in commanding their everyday life.  Cooper details how emotional strength has long been invalidated by oppressive systems because of the fear of its strength and clarity it provides though who use it. Coopers idea of “Eloquent Rage” can be extrapolated to “Insecure” when both Molly and Issa start to think about internal means of changing their environment instead of external means. Examining “Eloquent Rage” in conjunction with Molly and Issa revival in bettering their lives, students should learn to see how “Eloquent Rage” can be used by themselves and others around them to advance black feminist thought and their own ideals.

                  <p>A hot topic in “Insecure” is Molly’s homophobia to Jared’s single past gay experience. This homophobia is connected to a common theme of Molly regarding her longing for the perfect man, which Issa asserts as impossible and consistent with her too high standards. Molly comes to believe her broken pussy is to blame and goes through a pussy rejuvenation to no avail. Lorde’s book on the “Uses of the Erotic” shares a similar message of black womens sexuality being shaped and used by society for everyone but themselves. How does Lorde’s book on the “Uses of the Erotic” connect to Molly and Issa’s journey of understanding their sexuality and urges.  Pairing the reading and episode students should learn how black womens erotic is controlled by the patriarchy and needs to be reclaimed in order for black women to gain a sense of fullfillment and passion in their life. </p>

Knowing this, for the final class project students will engage in one or multiple interviews with a black women and explain how the concepts from class apply, can be used to understand, and/or helps your interviewee in her everyday life. The interview can be as broad or as specific as you want, but it should be related back to at least two themes or topics discussed in class. Students will turn in an essay that details the importance of black feminist thought in today's society and how it is being used or can be used to help black women in society on an individual level and how it can be applied to a larger scale. Through the assignments students should learn about the perspective of a black women they know and come to realize the pertinence of black feminist thought in today's society.
